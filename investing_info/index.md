Here is going to be all the investing concepts that I learn.

For investing there are several concepts you need to take in account:

* Macro economics
* Micro economics
* Fundamental analysis
* Technical analysis
* Sentiment analysis
* Risk management
* Trading psychology

Depending on what you want to do, you will need to focus on some of them more than others.

## Macro economics

Take in consideretion the macro economics is important because you can predict a movement in the market before it takes place.

For example, if you know that the FED is going to increase the interest rate, you can predict that the market is going to go down.

## Micro economics

Micro economics is important because you can predict the movement of a specific company.

For example, if you know that a company is going to release a new product, you can predict that the price of the stock is going to go up.

## Fundamental analysis

Fundamental analysis is the study of the financial statements of a company to determine the value of the company.

The financial statements are:

* Balance sheet
* Income statement
* Cash flow statement
* Statement of changes in equity
* Notes to the financial statements
* Management discussion and analysis
* Auditor's report
* Corporate governance
* Proxy statement

## Technical analysis

Technical analysis is the study of the price of a stock to determine the value of the stock.

The technical analysis is based on the following concepts:

* Support and resistance
* Trend lines
* Moving averages
* Volume
* Relative strength index
* Fibonacci retracement
* Candlestick patterns
* Chart patterns
* Point and figure charts
* Line break charts

Most of the technical analysis is based on the psychology of the market. And identifies possible movements in the market.

Thanks to the technical analysis we can try to create an investing system that could be automated.
