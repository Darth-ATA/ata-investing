# Swing Trading

The swing trading is a trading style that is based on the technical analysis. The main idea is to buy/sell in the swings of the market. The swings are the changes in the trend. The swing trading is a medium term trading style.

There are some rules to follow:

* We will only open positions in the direction of the trend
    * Bullish trend: we will only open long positions
    * Bearish trend: we will only open short positions
* We will wait until the cut of the direction of the trend and there is a correction in the price of 38% - 50% of Fibonacci but not more than 61.8% of Fibonacci
* We will use the Fibonacci levels to determine the stop loss and the take profit
    * Stop loss: 50% - 61.8% of Fibonacci
    * Take profit: we will be moving Stop Loss if we are succeeding in the trade
* We will open the position when there is a cut in the stocastic oscillator
    * Bullish trend: we will open the position when the stocastic oscillator cuts in the up direction
    * Bearish trend: we will open the position when the stocastic oscillator cuts in the down direction
* The stoploss will be the last relevant max/min
* Take profit will be the last relevant max/min in the opposite direction of the trend
